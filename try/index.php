        <p>Books are momentous in our life. It is rightly said that opening a book, opens a unique world. Books have turned out to be preordained to mankind. For majority of individuals, books are an inseparable part of the daily life. A book is like the most-trusted friend, who will, by no means, walk away from you at any time of life. Nothing can enhance the intellect more than reading a book. Books help in experiencing new things that one would not typically be able to experience. Books are crammed with knowledge, perceptions and give insights of teachings of life, love, hope and helpful guidance. Books have been our mentors for centuries; and without books, we could not have known about our ancestors, ancient cultures and civilizations. It is said that “the more you read, the more well-read you are”. So we can say that – more you read, more open you become; and there is a transformation in your outlook, your concepts and your imagination.
